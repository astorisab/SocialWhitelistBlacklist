# Social Websites Functional Whitelist and Blacklist

If anyone is interested in a whitelist or a blacklist for firewall settings when using Social Websites. Feel free to use this as a starting point. These are the connections that I currently have open on my computer and the ones that I have blocked.

# Linkedin

Allows Linkedin functionality to work without all the other added connections. *Lightly tested please write if a functionality is not working for you




Allow static.licdn.com when logging in and add to blocklist once logged in

The following link was used to access linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com

* Blocking static.licdn.com is viable and recommended once logged in. Recommended because I'm trying to use the site with as minimal connections as needed.

Functional for: Safari Browser

If looking for some blocklists related to blocking app functionality, this repo created by another github contributor may be of interest: https://github.com/d43m0nhLInt3r/socialblocklists
