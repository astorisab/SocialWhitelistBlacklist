# Social Websites Functional Whitelist and Blacklist

If anyone is interested in a whitelist or a blacklist for firewall settings when using Social Websites. Feel free to use this as a starting point. These are the connections that I currently have open on my computer and the ones that I have blocked.

# Linkedin

Allows Linkedin functionality to work without all the other added connections. *Lightly tested please write if a functionality is not working for you


Allow static.licdn.com when logging in and add to blocklist once logged in and the profile page as populated. Reload page to check functionality.

* Blocking static.licdn.com is viable and recommended once logged in. Recommended because I'm trying to use the site with as minimal connections as possible. You can choose to omit this in your functional blocklist if you want.

Functional for: Safari Browser

# Youtube (Non-Logged In User)

Currently a work in progress...

Current Functional Issues List:

[TO DO] - wildcard for allowing connections to video service

[TO DO] - limit on allowing connections to video service


To allow video streaming the following conditions should be followed:

1. An ask policy should be used for googlevideo.com
2. For each video streamed, the googlevideo.com domain should have one endpoint open * I do not condone getting around ads as this is how the service makes money. Ad videos have a video link as well. Once the ad is done the link can be closed.
3. When the video is finished being watched the video endpoint should be blocked *could lead to a lag in video service if left open. Not tested fully.
4. Upon clicking or hover over a new video of interest a corrisponding video should have a video stream link under an ask policy
5. Allow the link for the video of interest and repeat the steps above
