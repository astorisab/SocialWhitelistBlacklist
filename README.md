# Social Websites Functional Whitelist and Blacklist

If anyone is interested in a whitelist or a blacklist for firewall settings when using Social Websites. Feel free to use this as a starting point. These are the connections that I currently have open on my computer and the ones that I have blocked.

# Linkedin

Allows Linkedin functionality to work without all the other added connections. *Lightly tested please write if a functionality is not working for you




Allow static.licdn.com when logging in and add to blocklist once logged in and the profile page as populated. Reload page to check functionality.

The following link was used to access linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com

* Blocking static.licdn.com is viable and recommended once logged in. Recommended because I'm trying to use the site with as minimal connections as possible. You can choose to omit this in your functional blocklist if you want.

Functional for: Safari Browser

# Youtube (Non-Logged In User)

Currently a work in progress...

Current Functional issue list:
